        * Question of SMEs/other industrials in the consortium
        Deutsch Telekom (contacted but no reply  yet)
List of SMEs candidates :
Orange - peerialsm (CDN P2P approaches, already contacted, could join the telco)
Inria - nonstop
CRS4 - CIAM Servizi S.p.A. (they have a distributed infrastructure of renewable energies adn they sell energy. the idea is to put also computer at e
Inria -  Aoterra (quite similar, data furnaces)
CRS4 - Telecom Italia (no direct contact, check with G. Zanetti from CRS4) 
CRS4 - Tiscali (An Italian ISP, that provides also services)
 Stratio - Toni will contact them
Intercom  (CDN)
CRS4 (sequencer+computing facilities t / biology concerns / see whether they can benefit from the LUC infrastructure)


        * Envisioned use cases
        1./ Deliver cloud computing capabilities (i.e. IaaS ones) by directly leveraging existing backbone infrastructures
lead time to delivery 
Traffic isolation
reliability of resources/services
2./ CDN on demand, P2P youtube/dailymotion 
3./ MOOCs,  a kind of streaming services but with interactivity 
For the moment, we have CDN use cases
Regarding contacting other Telcos, pleas
e wait the answer of DT. 
Deploy specific infrastructures on demand (GPU clusters / tesbeds /)
4./ Flavien Q. =  Distributed data processing / hybrid cloud
        -1 sub use case could be the following one:
                *Users / companies can run small tasks on their own machines (using resource managers like Condor ~ desktop computing)
                *They can use more (powerful) machines hosted in PoPs to run the biggest tasks (in the same way companies buy network capacities to 
5./ Ramon N. "big data" use case: it is related with telecom companies and smart cities, analyzing mobile phone data directly from the antennas plac

It may make sense to launch VM's near the nodes where the data is generated

Requirement 
Outcome / expected results
Incentives
WP 1 - Architecture / Integration
Requirement identification 
Design the global architecture
Ensure the integration process

Dynamic scheduling (hot and cold migration throughout the infrastructure, which might include different domains)
Reliability 
WP 4 - VM Images
''Global Repository''
Deployment / snapshotting 
WP 5 - Security
Internal mechanisms of the LUC OS
Security of the VEs
WP 6 -  Application 
API to administrate/operate the LUC OS
API  for VM/VE management

Tesbeds
Simulators 
Grid'5000 Tesbeds
Representatives Testbeds: 
Leverage few PoPs and extend them with few servers in France / Poland and Greece
A link between private telco (Orange) and public NRENs, looks appealing but quite difficult)
we can ask some moneys to buy few servers but not for a complete infrastructure. 
WP 8 -  Management
WP - 9 Dissemination

ACTIONS :  
Adrien: 
       Create a discovery-h2020 mailing list : discovery-h2020@inria.fr
       Create a private repo for writing the proposal (in Tex)
       Revisits the structure of the WPs and make a new proposal by Friday.
All: 
       Brainstorm on use cases / expected results (please give a look to the current reference document, it is a bit longer than the fact sheet : ht

       Brainstorm on possible business model
