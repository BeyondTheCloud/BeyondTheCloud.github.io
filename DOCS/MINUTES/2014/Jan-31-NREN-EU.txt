Telco: 31st January
Attendees : 
    PSNC - Roman Lapacz 
    RENATER - Jean Francois Guezou
    GRNET - Panos Louridas
    
    

Agenda: 
Presentation of the Discovery initiative : http://beyondtheclouds.github.io
- No formal framework right now:
-Inria Project Lab is on-going
- ICT 

- GN4


Discussion about H2020 opportunities (ICT-7 - http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/topics/83-ict-07-2014.html )
Current Consortium: 

Orange Labs
Inria
CRS4 (Italia)
Renater
BSC (needs confirmation)

Currently in discussion: 
Deutsch Telekom
GRNET
PSNC

 Type of action : Research and innovations
Small (2 and 4Millions) or Large (5 and 8 Millions) ?  (66 millions are provisionned for ICT 7-a cf. page 84, for 2014)


GRNET:
one data-center operating by an open-stack fork cloudkit
you can find more details on the software here: http://www.synnefo.org/
users outside Greece can test the cloud here: https://okeanos-global.grnet.gr/home/
the production service for Greece is here: https://okeanos.grnet.gr/home/
and a technical overview here: https://www.usenix.org/publications/login/october-2013-volume-38-number-5/synnefo-complete-cloud-stack-over-ganeti
ideally we would like to see how synnefo could be used with the DISCOVERY software; synnefo is OpenStack compatible with extra features; we would see to the bridges / adapters etc. if required

there will be a wrapper to interact with cloud systems  but the LUC OS  will deal with much lower levels (such as hypervisor internals)
For instance Orange Labs want to adress IaaS++ Services 

another one planned next year
Experience: 
Software programming  (Scala)
reliability / image /...
Due to the production system, GRNET has a strong expertise on large centralized system so then can clearly list the mandatory mechanims that have to be revisited in a distributed fashion. 


Several PoPs but Hardware costs have to be provisionned (can we provision investissment costs - Need to be clarify)
The demonstrator should leverage at least few points in each partner (i.e. the Telcos/NRENs)   `
backup solution : Few Slices from the DCs already available

Opened questions: What can prevent the deployment of a discovery like approach in PSNC / GRNET
Complexity/Costs to deploy a micro DCs in each/Few PoPs of PSNC/GRNET  

PSNC: 
smartenIT (uNaDa concept) -http://www.smartenit.eu (LUC on user site)
NOVI project - interconnection of testbeds  http://www.fp7-novi.eu/
NREN for Poland, operates the national academic network PIONIER (POPs in main cities)
Extend POPs should be quite feasible by isolating few servers from few PoPs.
Experience: 
network technologies including SDNs (interested by network layer) 
use of existing solutions and development of new ones

We need to consider muti-domain issue
