% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.

% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
\AL[AL]{1 page (including the abstract)}

Although a lot of progress has been performed on Cloud Computing (CC)
system managements, \aka Infrastructure-as-a-service
toolkits~\cite{moreno:2012}, most of them
are still leveraging
elementary Virtual Machine (VM) placement policies that prevent them
to guarantee performance Service Level Agreements (SLAs) while
finely maximizing the usage of CC resources.
%to maximize the CC providers revenues.
%% THE TEXT BELOW COMES FROM ISPA'13
%%%%%%%
Generally, a batch scheduler
approach is used: VMs are
(i)~allocated according to user requests for resource reservations,
and (ii)~tied to the nodes where they were deployed until their
destruction. Besides the fact that user requests are often
overestimated, such policies are definitely not optimal for
CC providers, since the effective
resource requirements of each operated VM may significantly vary
during its execution.
%%%%%%%

Keep using  greedy allocation approaches in most of available IaaS
toolkits~\cite{openstack, opennebula, cloudstack} looks surprising
as the Virtual Machine Placement Problem (VMPP) has been addressed a
lot by the research community. Dynamic strategies such as
consolidation,  load-balancing and other SLAs guarantee algorithms
have been deeply investigated \cite{Hermenier:2009:ECM:1508293.1508300},\cite{feller:ccgrid12},
\cite{quesnel:cpe2012},
\cite{5935254}, \cite{5715067}, \cite{5328077}.
% under different software-architecture models (centralized
%\cite{Hermenier:2009:ECM:1508293.1508300}, hierarchical
%\cite{feller:ccgrid12} or distributed \cite{quesnel:cpe2012}).
From our point of view, a brake on the adoption of such advanced strategies is
related to the experimental process that has been used to validate the
pros and cons of each of them: Most of VMPP proposals have been
evaluated either by leveraging ad-hoc simulators or on testbeds that
in both cases are not accurate and not representative enough to (i)
ensure their correctness on real platforms and (ii) perform fair
comparisons between each of them.
%
Implementing each proposal and evaluating them on representative
testbeds in terms of scalability, reliability and workload changes
would definitely be the most rigorous way to validate and compare all
of them. However, delivering a prototype and conducting
\textit{in-vivo} (\ie real-world) experiments imply, when it is
possible, expensive and tedious tasks that might be counterproductive
if conclusions are far from the expected ones.
%

In this article, we propose the first version of a dedicated
simulation framework to perform in-depth investigations and compare VM
placement algorithms with each other in a fairly way. To cope with
real conditions such as their increasingly scale of modern data
centers and the dynamicity of the workloads that are specific to the
Cloud Computing paradigm (\ie elasticity capability), our framework
allows users to study large-scale scenarios taking into account server
crashes and involving tens of thousands of VMs, each one executing a
specific workload that evolves during the simulation lifetime.

We believe that such a tool will contribute to
our community as it will enable researchers to quickly identify and
compare the trends of a new proposal with existing ones. By such a
mean, it will be possible to limit \textit{in vivo} experiments only
to the algorithms that have the potential to handle Cloud Computing
production infrastructures.

%
We chose to build our tool on the \sg
framework~\cite{casanova:hal-01017319} since (i) its relevance in
terms of performance and validity has already been
demonstrated~\cite{simgridpub} and (ii) the framework has been
recently extended to integrate virtual machine and live migration
models \cite{Hirofuchi:2013:ALM:2568486.2568524}.

To illustrate the relevance of our tool, we implemented three VMPP
mechanisms \cite{Hermenier:2009:ECM:1508293.1508300}
\cite{feller:ccgrid12} \cite{quesnel:cpe2012} and analysis the pros
and cons of each them by discussing several metrics such as
scalability, reliability and reactivity (\ie the time to solve a SLA
violation). Besides being cited several times in the literature, we
chose these three systems as they are built on three different
software architecture models: centralized
\cite{Hermenier:2009:ECM:1508293.1508300}, hierarchical
\cite{feller:ccgrid12} and fully distributed \cite{quesnel:cpe2012}.


The rest of the article is organized as follow. Section \ref{sec:sg}

\ref{sec:injector} introduces our tool and discusses its internals
The three algorithms implemented as first use-cases are presented in
Section \ref{sec:vm-schedulers} and evaluated in Section \ref{sec:experiments}

\section{Simgrid, a generic toolkit}
\label{sec:sg}
\AL[AL]{0.5page}

\sg, is a  generic simulation toolkit to study the behavior of
large-scale distributed systems through a user-friendly programming
API.  Its specificities with respect to other simulation frameworks are
related to its scalability and its extensibility to address new
concerns. As an example, after Grids, HPC and P2P systems, \sg has
been recently extended with virtualization technologies abstractions
(\ie Virtual Machines and Live Migration model) to simulate Cloud
Computing infrastructures .

 It has been used in more than 100 publications

\label{sec:injector}
\AL[AL]{1.5 page}

\subsubsection{Description of the Simulator}
The simulator has been implemented in Java by leveraging the SimGrid toolkit~\cite{simgrid:uksim08}.
It is composed of three modules:

\begin{itemize}
\item The first module is in charge of changing the VMs' load during the
simulation.  Concretely it selects every $t$ seconds one VM hosted on
the simulated infrastructure and changes its load according to a
Gaussian distribution. $t$ is a random variable that follows an
exponential distribution with rate parameter $\lambda$ while the
Gaussian distribution is defined by a particular mean ($\mu$) as well
as a particular standard deviation ($\sigma$) that are given at each
simulation.  From the SimGrid point of view, a VM is just an
abstraction.  Hence changing the load of a VM corresponds to assigning
a new value to its CPU property.  Finally, we considered the size of
the memory assigned to a VM as a rigid resource (i.e., it is defined at
the beginning of each run and does not change).
%%
\item The second module of our simulator corresponds to the centralized
version of the scheduling problem: This
SimGrid Agent corresponds to an infinite loop that iteratively invokes
Entropy by triggering a `repair process' that aims at satisfying the
QoS properties of the VMs by leveraging all available PMs.
By default the Entropy framework waits 30 seconds before triggering a new `repair
process' but in order to be as reactive as possible, this time has been
reduced to 1 second.
%%
\item Finally, the last module implements the DVMS proposal as previously described.
%%
\end{itemize}

In each concerned module, the execution of each scheduling computation is really performed
(i.e., Entropy instances are really invoked with the current configuration
handled by the simulator). Hence, the computation time that is observed is not
simulated but corresponds to the effective one. It is worth noting that in
order to limit the computation time of the computation phase, we
set a timeout equal to one fourth of the number of nodes
considered (in seconds) for each Entropy invocation.
This timeout was determined empirically by preliminary experiments with 512 and 1024 PMs.
Last but not the least, the presented results do not address the cost of the
third phase of the scheduling problem (i.e., the relocation actions). As SimGrid
does not simulate VM migrations yet, the reconfiguration plan is only logically
performed: When a VM needs to be migrated, we only change its location
property.  The cost of VM migrations has been analyzed through real
experiments conducted on Grid'5000 (cf.\ Section \ref{subsec:g5k-exp}).
