\AL[MS]{1.5 pages}

We now present the Snooze framework for VM
management~\cite{feller:ccgrid12} as a third case study of how
to implement and simulate advanced distributed algorithms.

\subsubsection{Snooze architecture and  algorithm}

We first briefly present the Snooze architecture summarizing its
original presentation~\cite{feller:ccgrid12} and providing some
aditional info~\cite{snoozedev14,snoozeweb}.

\begin{itemize}
  \item GLs, GMs, LCs
  \item Correct execution
  \item Fault behavior
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Simulation with Simgrid}

Snooze can be simulated using our model and tool support in a direct
and natural manner.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Representation of GLs, GMs, LCs
  \item Multicast node
  \item Multi-threading
  \item Reaction to faults
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Variants}

It is also possible to quite simply implement and simulate variants of
the Snooze model that we have simulated. These variants represent
interesting non-trivial evolutions of the original Snooze model that
have not been explored as part of Snooze. Concretely, we present the
following evolutions:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Periodic vs.\ reactive scheduling:} 
  \item \textbf{Load balancing:} Snooze's implementation assigns LCs
    in a round-robin fashion. We can simply implement simulate other
    asignment schemes, e.g., load balancing schemes.
  \item \textbf{Variants of join algorithms:}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{GMs rejoin on GM entry:} The Snooze
        paper~\cite{feller:ccgrid12} states that all GMs should rejoin if a new
        GMs enters the system (perhaps for load balancing). This is
        implemented in the Snooze simulation. However, this strategy
        makes the system instable, because of frequent joins of GMs
        that are not available during a relatively long
        time. Furthermore, this entails joins of many LCs. Overall
        this strategy seems unreasonable.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
