\section{Reference architecture for IaaS clouds}

Recent studies have showed that state of the art IaaS manager \cite{peng:2009}
were constructed over the same concepts. Furthermore a reference architecture 
for IaaS manager has been described in \cite{moreno2012iaas} enabling the design
of an IaaS toolkit. Besides the reference architecture, an IaaS toolkit should
provides some mechanisms that enables to solve the scalability problem.

In a recent study, authors have proposed a reference architecture for 
a Cloud OS \cite{moreno2012iaas}: they aimed at providing abstractions of 
underlying technologies that compose current IaaS managers. The strength of 
their work resides in the fact that they considered all the needs of an 
"industrial class" IaaS manager: each of its functions has been widely studied.
Beacause we find this work well detailed, we have decided that a new 
architectural proposition for a distributed IaaS manager should leverage this 
work.
