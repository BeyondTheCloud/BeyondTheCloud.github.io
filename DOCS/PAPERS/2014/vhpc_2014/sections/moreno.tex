\section{Reference architecture for IaaS clouds}
\label{sec:moreno}

% - Designing LUC-OS -> complex (Cloud : a lot of aspects).
% - study existing Cloud architecture -> anticipation of these problems.
%    -> enable LUC-OS to leverage existing experience.
% - This will minimize conception effort -> maximize time spend on prototype.
% - This section -> highlight existing architectural principles (in order to use
%    them)
Designing an architecture for the LUC-OS is a complex task: it has to manage all
the very diverse aspects of a Cloud infrastructure. A good way to anticipate 
them is to study how the architecture of existing cloud solutions have been 
organized: this will enable the LUC-OS to leverage experience acquired by others
in the conception of IaaS managers, thus minimizing the conception effort, and
maximizing time allowed to build a first prototype. This section targets to 
highlight existing architectural principles used by current Cloud manager, in 
order to make the LUC-OS leverage them.


% - Cloud Computing -> like electricity market.
% - Big fishes have emerged -> their APIs have become defacto standard.
% - emerging market -> yet no ISO norm, but standardization is coming.
% - Despite recent efforts, "data lock-in" still exists.
% - This lack of standardization is a drag on Cloud computing adoption.
Cloud computing is a model where companies consume computing resources produced 
by external cloud providers. This model has lead to a structure similar to the 
electricity market: in the same way electrical providers have build huge 
infrastructures for generating and transporting energy, Cloud providers now 
leverage data-centers that can host more than tens of thousands of servers. As 
this is an emerging industry, normalization is still at an early stage: several 
ISO norms will been soon released and many consortiums have been created to 
promote the use of standards by Cloud Computing actors. However, this market is 
dominated by few actors (Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Rackspace, ...) that exploit
proprietary technologies, thus standardization has been delayed and de facto 
standards have emerged. Furthermore, despite recent efforts made to avoid "data
lock-in", migration from one Cloud provider to another one is still difficult to 
achieve. All these factors are a drag on the adoption of Cloud computing.

% - To enable companies to manage their data in the way they want 
%   -> private clouds.
% - OpenSource IaaS manager have been developed (OpenStack, Open Nebula
%   ,...) to host private clouds.
% - Some studies compared them:
%    * They manipulate the same concepts (VMs, Networks, Storages, ...).
%    * They have architectural differences (CloudStack -> monolithic, OpenStack 
%      -> components, Eucalyptus -> AWS).
To keep the control on their data, organizations can leverage internally hosted 
Cloud infrastructure : private Clouds enable the utilization of the Cloud 
computing paradigm without depending to a Cloud provider. For this purpose, 
open-source IaaS managers have emerged: several of them have become popular with
large communities of developers and are used by large actors. Recent studies 
\cite{peng:2009} have compared these projects and it appears that while they 
almost manipulate same concepts (VMs, Networks, Storages, ...), there is a lack 
of consensus on what they target: Eucalyptus focuses on building an 
infrastructure that shares the same API as Amazon AWS, while projects like 
OpenStack and CloudStack have targeted the delivery of a complete IaaS that can
operate large cloud infrastructures by using its own tools. This leads to an 
architectural heterogeneity : CloudStack’s development has been oriented towards
a monolithic architecture, while OpenStack is composed of loosely-coupled 
message passing managers and Eucalyptus follows the Amazon AWS services’
architecture.

% - Architectural differences -> Moreno's reference architecture.
% - several managers.
To cope with these architectural differences, Moreno et al. have proposed a 
reference architecture \cite{moreno2012iaas} for IaaS clouds. This architecture 
covers services that are needed for building a Cloud OS : each aspect of the 
cloud is supervised by a specific manager. The following listing gives a 
description of principal services that authors expect in a Cloud OS:
\begin{description}
	
	\item [Virtual machines manager] is the most important part of the Cloud OS:
	it manages VMs' cycle of life (configuration, deployment, 
	migration, suspension, resume, shut down and sometimes migrations). It is 
	also responsible for preserving service-level agreements (SLAs).

	\item [Scheduler] decides which server will run a newly created virtual 
	machine by taking into account several parameters (static scheduling). To 
	preserve a good quality of service, overloaded servers may migrate virtual
	machines on underloaded servers (dynamic scheduling).

	\item [Image manager] manages virtual machines' images. As users have their
	own images with specific systems or configurations, this manager must be 
	able to handle a large number of images in a distributed manner.

	\item [Network manager] provides connectivity to the infrastructure: virtual
	networks for VMs, external access for users. The current trend is to the
	virtualisation of networking devices through the use of Software
	Defined Networks (SDN). This manager must enable flexible networking 
	deployment without losing performance (bandwidth and latency).

	\item [Storage manager] provides persistent storage facilities to virtual 
	machines. As physical single storage device might be a source of failure,
	factors like distribution and redundancy must be anticipated.

	\item [Administrative tools] provides tools and user interfaces to perform
	administration tasks. This is the components that enables users access to
	the Cloud OS internals.

	\item [Information manager, Accounting/auditing ] collects raw monitoring 
	data of the infrastructure and produce value-added from the raw data 
	respectively. As authors mentioned it, both are very important for billing
	process.

\end{description}

The other managers, not included in the preceding listing, are either taking 
place at different level in the Cloud Computing hierarchy (\emph{Service 
manager} is likely to be at PaaS level) or either too advanced for a first Cloud
OS prototype (\emph{Cloud Interfaces} exposes a cloud API to external users; 
\emph{Federation manager} enables the access to remote Clouds.) or is of little 
scientific interest for the Cloud OS (\emph{Information manager} gather VMs 
state information, as many tools meet this need, the Cloud OS will simply 
reuse them).

% - We want to develop a Cloud OS.
% - Develop from scratch: impossible (herculean work) -> maximize the reuse of
%   existing components.
% - We propose to leverage the reference architecture proposed by Moreno.
% - In order to develop a prototype, we focus of vital components.
We target the development of the LUC-OS : a fully distributed Cloud OS that can 
provides essential features proposed by current opens source IaaS managers. As
developing a complete Cloud OS is an herculean work, trying to maximize the 
reuse of existing works is a way to minimize both design and implementation 
efforts. Indeed, our first objective is to leverage the best practices 
established by the analysis of today's IaaS managers. We think that leveraging
this reference architecture is the most obvious way to cope with this first
objective.
