\section{Designing the LUC-OS}
\label{sec:lucos}

% - Distributed clouds : hundreds micro DCs, which are themselves composed of up
%   to tens of servers 
% - Managing a distributed cloud -> managing thousands of geographically spread 
%   hosts.
% - P2P file sharing systems: example of software that works well in similar
%   conditions.
% - We think the file sharing systems should be an inspiration for the LUC-OS
%   design.
A massively distributed cloud is an infrastructure that is composed of up to 
hundreds of micro DCs, which are themselves composed of up to tens of servers, 
thus operating such infrastructure means managing up to thousands of
geographically spread servers. Designing software that works at this scale is a
tedious task, as it comes with challenges such as preserving a good reactivity 
and implementing working fault tolerance mechanisms. Peer to peer file sharing 
systems (popular over the last decade) are a good example of software that works
well at large scale in a context where computing resources are geographically 
spread. That is why we propose to learn from the experience of large scale peer 
to peer systems : design rules of the LUC-OS architecture will be directly 
inspired by them. 

\subsection{Design rules}

% - LUC-OS: distributed system: workload divided among every peers.
% - LUC-OS is a multi-agent system: each server (node) of the infrastructure 
%   host one LUC-OS agent.
% - A LUC-OS agent is composed of several services, each service is specialized
%   in a particular task.
% - To prevent bottlenecks and single point of failure, each service is 
%   distributed in a fully distributed manner: 
%    * bottleneck: in case a service is overloaded, it must be able to balance
%      workload on remote service instance.
%    * single point of failure: at large scale, failure becomes the norm rather
%      than the exception, services must implement self healing mechanisms and
%      each persistent state is stored in fault tolerant data structure (DHT).
% - To maximize the reactivity of the LUC-OS, a service should prioritize 
%   collaboration with corresponding services hosted on servers accessible with
%   low latency.
% - To enable low-latency collaborations, each service will leverage a locality
%   based overlay that will dynamically maintain for each server a list of 
%   neighbors.
The LUC-OS targets a fully distributed functioning inspired by the peer to peer
paradigm : its workload will be allocated over among every element constituting
the infrastructure. As we are interested by adding advanced properties 
(self-organization and self-healing) to the LUC-OS, we propose to leverage a 
multi-agent architecture: each node (server) constituting the infrastructure 
will host one of the LUC-OS agent. To prevent negative phenomenons such as
bottlenecks and single points of failure (SPOF), we have decided to anticipate
them during the design stage:

\begin{description}

  \item [Bottlenecks] : are caused by an excessive workload allocated to one 
  service, which slows its interactions with collaborators, thus impacting
  negatively the performance of the infrastructure by reducing both reactivity 
  and quality of service (QoS). Indeed, when a service is overloaded, it is 
  better to enable him to distribute the workload on several remote instances 
  that are underloaded.

  \item [Single points of failure] (SPOF) represents an element of a system, 
  that in case of failure, stops the entire system. As at large scale, failure 
  becomes the norm rather than the exception, SPOFs are a major concern in
  distributed software: that is why services must implement self healing 
  mechanisms such as redundancy. In addition each persistent state have to be 
  stored in fault tolerant data structure.

\end{description}


\subsection{Virtual environments}

% - Ressource allocation -> group of VMs.
% - Interconnection though virtual environment (VE).
% - specific requirement (hardware, placement) -> VE's constraint
% - Challenge: managing VEs in a fully distributed manner (p2p): 
%    -> ex of vm placement
The LUC-OS enables its users to request the creation of groups of VMs. These
VMs are interconnected in a virtual environment (VE) though the use of a virtual
network. Users may have specific requirements in terms of hardware and 
placement: this will result in constraints that will be integrated to the VE. 
Designing the LUC-OS raises the problem of managing VEs in a fully distributed 
manner: as the effort of hosting VEs will be spread over several LUC-OS nodes, 
thus some mechanims that constitute IaaS needs to be revisited. For instance, 
VMs placement is typically decided by centralized service nodes, while there are
peer to peer alternatives such as DMVS \cite{quesnel:ispa2013}. Related to the 
former point, when a VM is relocated on another LUC-OS node, the node should now
take part its VE by sharing the hosting effort in terms of computing ressources,
networking and storage.


\subsection{Overlay Networks and Locality}

% - Overlay network -> logical network build on top of another networks.
% - abstraction for networking things (routing, lookup, fault tolerance).
% - LUC-OS will leverage this LBO and thus take full advantage of reactive 
%   inter-agent collaborations.
An overlay network is a logical network build on top of another physical or 
logical network, which enables to abstract networking things such as routing, 
lookup retrieval, and fault tolerance. One of the downsides of using overlay 
networks is that they break the physical topology by connecting nodes that have 
no physical proximity, thus leading to a network overhead. In 
\cite{pastor:hal-00991530} authors proposed a Locality Based Overlay Network 
(LBO) that leverages the Vivaldi algorithm \cite{dabek:2004:vivaldi}: leveraging
an algorithm according to their respective latencies, the LBO computes for each 
node a dynamic coordinate. Each node maintains a list of close contacts that are
periodically and randomly exchanged. This enables to build a distributed map of 
the infrastructure. The LBO enables high level applications to be aware of 
locality properties and thus to organize inter-agent collaborations in a way 
that minimize the network overhead and that improve the overall reactivity. The 
LUC-OS will also leverage the LBO to take a full advantage of these reactive and
minimized overhead inter-agent collaborations.





\subsection{Anatomy of a LUC-OS agent}

% - Figure \ref{fig:anatomy} -> our choices
% - 4 services: one service per aspect (compute, network, persistance, admin). 
% - Compute service: delivery of computing resources: built on top of:
%    * VMs broker: receives VM creation request, elect a server: it instantiate 
%      the VM; ensures VM creation.
%    * VMs scheduler: ensures good QoS for VMs: compute node overloaded ->
%      sched balances workload on underloaded ones (dynamic scheduling).
% - Network service: create virtual that interconnect VMs (broker). Network 
%   creation abstracted by the use network drivers (OpenFlow, Mininet, ...).
% - As some services manipulate hardware -> direct access via Hardware Drivers.
% - Persistence service: store states manipulated by the services of the LUC-OS:
%    * Objects (serializable entities); VMs images (VMs template) belonging to a 
%      specific user (+ metadata); VMs snapshots: like VM images with versions.
% - These sub-services leverage a DHT, and some of them leverage a resilient 
%   distributed FS.
% - Administrative: managing the infrastructure and producing statistical and 
%   usage data.
% - To perform those tasks it will leverage a DHT and a service that store 
%   execution logs of the infrastructure.

\label{sec:anatomy_lucos}
Figure \ref{fig:anatomy} depicts our architectural choices: each aspect of the 
LUC-OS is managed by a specific service that will collaborate with close 
instances of the service located on remote nodes through the use of locality
based network overlay. 

\subsubsection{Compute service}
is in charge of the delivery of computing power: it is built on top of two 
sub-services : \emph{VMs Spawner} is responsible for VMs creations with static 
scheduling and \emph{VMs Scheduler} guarantees a good QoS by performing dynamic 
scheduling. While these tasks are typically performed by centralized service 
nodes, the LUC-OS take up the challenge of doing them in a fully distributed
manner.

  \label{fig:anatomy}%
  %\vspace*{-.8cm}
\end{figure*}

\subsubsection{Network service} 
leverages a \emph{Virtual Network Broker} that create virtual networks 
interconnecting VMs. Creation of these virtual networks is abstracted by the use
of \emph{Networking drivers}: it enables the use of a wide range of network 
technology such as OpenFlow and Mininet. As all services composing Compute 
service and network drivers manipulate hardware, they will have direct access to
hardware via Hardware Drivers. To maintain a good QoS, VMs may be relocated on 
far away LUC-OS agents: this block must be able to maintain the connectivity 
inside the VE of migrated VMs.

\subsubsection{Persistence service}
is dedicated to keeping states of the LUC-OS by leveraging one service for each
kind of state: \emph{Objects} are used to persist serializable entities 
manipulated by the LUC-OS, \emph{VMs Images} are used for VMs template files 
(which belong to a specific user), \emph{VMs Snapshots} are pretty much the same
as VM images except that they support versionning. All the sub-services that 
compose the Persistence service leverage a \emph{Distributed Data Store}.As at 
large scale, failure becomes the norm rather than the exception, this service 
will rely on fault tolerant mechanims that ensure the availability of stored 
ressources in case of nodes failures.

\subsubsection{Administrative service} 
will perform tasks such as managing the infrastructure and producing statistical
and usage data. To perform those tasks it will leverage the \emph{Distributed 
Data Store} and a service that stores execution logs of the infrastructure. The 
main challenge is to give the ability to users to manage their VEs from any 
LUC-OS agent, whether it is sharing its VEs hosting effort or not.
