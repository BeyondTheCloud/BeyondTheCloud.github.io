Introduced few years ago \cite{greenberg:sigcomm09}, the new trend to deliver
cloud computing resources, in particular Infrastructure as a Service solutions
(IaaS), consists in leveraging several infrastructures distributed world-wide.
If such distributed cloud computing platforms deliver undeniable advantages to
address important challenges such as reliability, latency or even in somehow
jurisdiction concerns, most mechanisms that were previously used to operate
centralized IaaS platforms must be revisited to offer the same level of
transparency for the end-users.  Keeping such an objective in mind, the use of
P2P paradigm is strongly investigated. This is particularly true for instance
for scheduling algorithms in charge of assigning VMs on top of PMs according to
their effective needs (and reciprocally usages).  Indeed and although major
improvements have been done, centralized approaches \cite{hermenier:2013} are
neither scalable nor robust enough.  Hierarchical solutions
\cite{feller:ccgrid12} that can be seen as good candidates face important
limitations: First, finding an efficient partitioning of resources is a tedious
task as matching a hierarchical overlay on top of a distributed infrastructure
is often not natural.  Second, in addition to requiring complex failover
mechanisms to ensure leader/super peer crashed and network disconnections,
hierarchical structures have not been designed to react swiftly to physical
topology changes such as node apparitions/removals and network performance
degradations.  P2P algorithms enable to address both concerns, \ie scalability
as well as resiliency of infrastructures. However and although, promising
approaches have been proposed to address the scheduling problem of VMs in a P2P
fashion \cite{quesnel:2012,feller:cloudcom12}, they are still facing
limitations related to the overlay network they rely on. The approach propopsed
in~\cite{quesnel:2012} matches a ring overlay  on a distributed infrastructures
witch prevents making any distinction between close nodes and distant ones.
Similarly, the approach in~\cite{feller:cloudcom12}, while adopting an
orthogonal, gossip-based approach, still suffers from building a randomized
overlay, thus breaking the physical topology.

Considering that both the network latency and the bandwidth between peers have
a strong impact on the reactivity criteria of the scheduling problem,
\emph{locality} properties of peers should be considered to favor efficient VM
operations.  In other words, to reduce as much as possible the time to switch
from one schedule (\ie a mapping between VMs and PMs running in the
infrastructure) to another one, it is crucial to make cooperation first between
the closest neighborhoods before contacting peers belonging to other sites.
Moreover, it is noteworthy that this notion of locality is dynamic over the
time according to the network bandwidth/latency and disconnection.

The contribution of this paper is a new building block  that enables to tackle
the \emph{locality} concern in distributed VM scheduling algorithms such as the two aforementioned ones. 
% TODO open the discussion in the conclusion: Although the advantage of the
% contribution has been illustrated by revisiting the DVMS proposal, we believe
% that the proposed building block can be used in several distributed
% mechanisms based on a cooperative approach. 
We estimate the locality through a cost function of the latency/bandwidth tuple
between peers in the network, thus enabling each peer to select its closest
neighbors. We rely on Vivaldi~\cite{refquivabien}, a simple decentralized
protocol allowing to map a topology in a logical space while preserving
locality.  On top of Vivaldi, a shortest path construction similar to the
well-known Dijkstra algorithm is performed, each time there is a need for
cooperation between two nodes taking part in the schedule. 
We illustrate the advantage of this new building block by  changing the overlay in the
DVMS proposal~\cite{quesnel:2012}.  We selected DVMS  as we have a good
expertise of it and because it is, as far as we know, the only one that
guarantees to find a solution if there is an existing one \cite{quesnel:ispa2103}.
                                                   
The remainder of this article is structured as follows. In Section \ref{sec:back}, we
discuss some background regarding the DVMS proposal and the P2P technics to
deliver locality aspects.  Section \ref{sec:contribs} gives an overview of our proposal by
introducing the short path algorithm on top of  Vivaldi and the way we
integrate it into DVMS.  In Section \ref{sec:exps}, we validate the proposal by analyzing
its benefits with respect to the previous version of DVMS by discussing experiments conducted on Grid'5000. Related work is
disscued in Section \ref{sec:related}. Finally, we discuss perspectives and conclude this
article in Section \ref{sec:con}.
