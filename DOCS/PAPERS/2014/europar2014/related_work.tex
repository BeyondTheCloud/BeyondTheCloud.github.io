\subsection{Efficient Virtual Machine Management}

Many virtual infrastructure managers have been proposed to deal with specific
concerns.
%
In this section, we will focus on some of their limitations, especially
regarding locality, scalability and fault-tolerance.

The most common managers are the centralized ones, like
Entropy~\cite{hermenier:cp11,hermenier:2013}, since they are easy to deploy.
%
They are generally designed to work on a cluster.
%
In this context, they do not take account of the network topology, and they
cannot manage VMs efficiently in a multi-site deployment.
%
Moreover, they are prone to fault-tolerance, scalability and reactivity
issues; to avoid these limitations, one possibility is to rely on more
decentralized approaches, like hierarchical or distributed ones.

Hierarchical managers, like Snooze~\cite{feller:ccgrid12}, may be more suited to
handle locality.
%
For instance, it is possible to setup (i)~one manager per cluster, and (ii)~one
(fault-tolerant) super manager that monitors cluster managers and chooses on
which cluster a new VM should start.
%
%A VM will generally stay on the cluster where it was deployed during its whole
%life cycle.
%
The main problem with this approach is that, in the absence of cooperation
between cluster managers, VMs cannot be migrated from one cluster to another,
which is especially annoying if one cluster is overloaded.
%
Moreover, the super manager is not necessarily aware of the network topology and
therefore may not be able to interact efficiently with cluster managers if the
latter are distributed among several sites.
%
Furthermore, the super manager limits the scalability of this approach; to deal
with this issue, researchers have designed distributed approaches.

Many distributed approaches have been proposed to manage
VMs~\cite{barbagallo:lncs10,feller:cloudcom12,marzolla:wowmom11,mastroianni:europar11,rouzaudcornabas:vhpc10,yazir:cloud10}.
%
Some of them are limited in terms of scalability since they (i)~require a global
view of the infrastructure to take a
decision~\cite{rouzaudcornabas:vhpc10,yazir:cloud10} and/or (ii)~rely on a
centralized service node that is not
fault-tolerant~\cite{mastroianni:europar11,yazir:cloud10}.
%
Some approaches lead to a huge number of
migrations~\cite{barbagallo:lncs10,mastroianni:europar11} without necessarily
optimizing the chosen scheduling criterion~\cite{barbagallo:lncs10}.
%
Moreover, none of these approaches have been designed to take account of the
network topology and therefore manage VMs efficiently in a multi-site
deployment.

To summarize, a locality-aware distributed approach is required to (i)~avoid
issues related to scalability and single points of failures, and to (ii)~manage
VMs efficiently in heterogeneous network environments like those found in
multi-site deployments.
