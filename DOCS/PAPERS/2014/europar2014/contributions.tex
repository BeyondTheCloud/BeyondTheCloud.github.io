\CT{Vivaldi + spirale}

We here present our lazy locality-aware overlay network which underlies the VM
scheduling platform we developed. It is made of two layers. The lower layer
strongly rely on the Vivaldi protocol to make nodes aware of their position in
the platform. The higher layer takes its roots in the classic Dijkstra's
shortest parth algorithm to collect a set of close nodes starting from a given
position.

\CT{The remaining of the section is based on the book chapter.}

\subsubsection*{Giving a position to nodes}

The initial configuration of the physical network can take an arbitrary
shape. As already mentioned, Vivaldi~\cite{dabek:2001:sigcomm04} is a
distributed protocol assigning coordinates in the plane to nodes of a
distributed set of nodes. Each node is equipped with a \emph{view} of the
network, \emph{i.e.}, a set of nodes it knows. Coordinates obtained by a node
reflects its \emph{position} in the network, \emph{i.e.}, close nodes in the
network are given close coordinates in the plane. To achieve this, each node
checks the round trip time between itself and another node (randomly chosen
among nodes in its view) and adapts its distance (by changing its coordinates)
with this node in the plane accordingly. % See Figure~\ref{fig:vivaldi_before} and
% Figure~\ref{fig:vivaldi_after} for an illustration of 4 nodes~(A, B, C and D)
% moving according to the Vivaldi protocol.
A globally accurate positioning of nodes can be
obtained if nodes have a few long-distance nodes in their
view~\cite{dabek:2001:sigcomm04}. These long distance links can be easily
maintained by means of a simple gossip protocol.

%                   positions of other nodes have been updated.}

\subsubsection*{Searching for Close Nodes}

Once the map is achieved (each node knows its coordinates), we are able to
decide whether two nodes are \emph{close} by calculating their
distance. However, the view of each node does not \emph{a priori} contain its
closest nodes. Therefore, we need additional mechanisms to locate a set of nodes
that are close to a given initial node -- Vivaldi gives a \emph{location} to
each node, not a neighborhood. We use a modified distributed version of the
classic Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. The goal is to build a
\emph{spiral}\footnote{The term \emph{spiral} is here a misuse of language,
since the graph actually drawn in the plane might contain crossing edges.}
interconnecting the nodes in the plane that are the closest ones to a given
initial node.

Let us consider that our initial point is a node called $I$. The first step is
to find a node to build a two-node spiral with $I$. Such a node is sought in the
view of $I$ by selecting the node, say $S$, having the smallest distance with
$I$. $I$ then sends its view to $S$, $I$ stores $S$ as its successor in the
spiral, and $S$ adds $I$ as its predecessor in the spiral. Then $I$ forwards its
view to $S$. $S$ creates a new view by keeping the $n$ nodes which are the
closest to $I$ in the views of $I$ and $S$. This last view is then referred to
as the \emph{spiral view} and is intended to contain a set of nodes among which
to find the next step of the spiral. Then $S$ restarts the same process: among
the spiral view, it chooses the node with the smallest distance to $I$, say
$S'$, and adds it in the spiral -- $S$ becomes the predecessor of $S'$ and $S'$
becomes the successor of $S$. Then, the spiral view is sent to $S'$ which
updates it with the nodes it has in its own view. The process is repeated until
enough nodes have been gathered (which is a parameter sent by the application).

Note that one risk is to be blocked by having a spiral view containing only
nodes that are already in the spiral, leading to the impossibility to build the
spiral further. However, this problem can be easily addressed by forcing the
presence of a few long distance nodes whenever it is updated.

\subsubsection*{Learning}

Applying the protocol described above, the quality of the spiral is
questionable in the sense that the nodes that are actually close to the initial
node $I$ may not be included.%  The only property ensured is that one step
% forward on the built path always takes us further from the initial node.
%
To improve the \emph{quality} of the spiral, \emph{i.e.}, reduce the average
distance between the nodes it comprises and the initial node, we rely on a
learning mechanism coming with no extra communication cost: when a node is
contacted for becoming the next node in one spiral, and receives the associated
spiral view, it can also keep the nodes that are the closest to itself, thus
potentially increasing the quality of a future spiral construction.

\subsection{Library for locality based algorithm}

%   * Construire des algos distribues fonctionnant en reseau est dur: couts 
% 	  impliques par la tolerance aux pannes et synchro.
%   * Ces couts sont parfois dus aux modeles de programmation.
Building a distributed algorithm that works at large scale is complex: fault
tolerance, synchronization and network overhead can have a cost that 
significantly impact on performance and scalability. This can be the result of a
bad software design, or the consequence of the use of an inapropriate 
programming model for a given situation, as sharing states in a distributed
context.

%   * La collaboration entre processus peut se faire de deux maniere:
%       A) partage d'etat.
%       B) echange de message.
This is especially true in situation where a process share a ressource with some 
other processes. This situation, also known as \emph{race condition situation}, 
has been thoroughly studied, which led to different ways to organize 
collaboration between concurrent actors that have to work concurrently:

\begin{description}

	\item [Shared state] : A ressource is shared between different processes: it
	requires that each process waits for its turn before acquiring it for use.
	This property can be guaranteed by using locks to control acces to shared
	ressource : processes have to wait that the ressource becomes free
	before using it.

	\item [Message passing] : Each process has its own state and collaborate
	with other processes by exchange of messages. In the case of the actor model 
	\cite{Hewitt1973}, a process becomes an \emph{actor} wich processes one
	message at a time. This is a lock free approach with no	shared state.

\end{description}

%   * les verrous sont des nids a deadlocks.
% 	* DVMS utilise le modele d'acteurs:
%		- chaque instance ne communique qu'avec des messages.
%		- on favorise les collaborations proches.
Locking ressources often leads to deadlock \cite{agha:1986}, which can have
a significant impact on performance and scalability. That is why we decided to
leverage the actor model to reoarganize DVMS: each instance will collaborate
by exclusively exchanging messages and priority will be given to collabarotion
between close instances.

%   * ainsi on a créé une librarie qui:
%		- favorise le dvlpt d'appli distribuée.
%		- se base sur des langages/frameworks modernes.
%	* la librairie se base sur la prog fonctionnelle et le peerActor.
With that in mind, we created a new library whose role is to ease the
development of distributed application: it is based on modern piece of software
(Scala and akka) based on the actor model. This library makes intensive use of
functionnal programming and the concept of \emph{peer actor}.

\subsubsection{Peer actor abstraction}

%   * Peer actor:
%		- apporte la tolerance aux pannes, abstraction du réseau, communication
%		  interservices.
%		- propose une API pour développer vite.
\emph{Peer actor} is an actor that provides several features: fault tolerance,
network abstraction, communication between services. It provides an API that 
enables the fast developement of distributed application : connection between
instances of the application is automatically maintained, meaning that all 
efforts can be concentrated on designing algorithms.

%   * Peer actor deux sous acteurs:
%		- notification actor: systeme a evenement pour les services.
%		- network overlay actor: réseau avec implémentation chord et vivaldi.
Peer actor contains two sub actors: \emph{notification actor} and \emph{network
overlay actor}. Notification actor enables services to subscribe to events that
will be triggered by other services. Network overlay actor is in charge of 
sending/receiving message through network. There exist two implementations of 
this network overlay actor: one is based on a Chord ring \cite{stoica2001chord},
while the other is based on vivaldi algorithm to leverage locality properties.
