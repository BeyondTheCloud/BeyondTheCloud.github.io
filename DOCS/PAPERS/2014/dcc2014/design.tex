\subsection{Massively distributed cloud}

\begin{itemize}

	\item A massively distributed cloud targets management of thousand of hosts around a wide territory.	
	
	\item This scale order is currently reaches by file sharing systems like bittorrent.

	\item We propose to leverage on peer to peer mechanisms to reach an high scalability IaaS.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Toolkit for IaaS}

\begin{itemize}

	\item A toolkit is a building block that is used for construction of systems.

	\item In the massively distributed IaaS case, the toolkit will have to consider scalability and locality concerns.

	\item The toolkit will have to integrate well on existing systems: we propose to leverage Openstack project.

\end{itemize}
