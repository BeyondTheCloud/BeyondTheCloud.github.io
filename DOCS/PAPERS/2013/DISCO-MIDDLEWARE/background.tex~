\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

Several generations of UC have been proposed and still 
co-exist \cite{foster:2011}. However, neither Desktop, nor Grid, nor Cloud Computing platforms provide a satisfying UC model. 
Contrary to the current trend that promotes large offshore centralized
DCs as the UC platform of choice, we claim that the only way to
achieve sustainable and highly efficient UC services is to target a
new infrastructure that better matches the Internet structure. 
Because it aims at gathering an
unprecedented amount of widely distributed computing resources into a
single platform providing UC services close to the end-users, a LUC infrastructure is  
fundamentally different from existing ones. 
Keeping in mind the aforementioned objectives, recycling
UC resource management solutions developed in the past is doomed to failure.

To avoid confusion, our vision differs from hybrid cloud computing solutions. 
Although these research activities address important concerns related to the
use of federated cloud platforms such as the standardization of the interfaces 
for supporting cooperation and resource sharing over Cloud federations, their propositions are incremental
improvements of the existing UC models. From our point of view, hybrid and
cloud federation investigations are comparable in some ways to previous works
that have been done for Grids and where, the purpose of the Grid middleware is
to interact with each resource management system composing the Grid \cite{rochwerger:2009}, \cite{buyya:2010}. By taking
into account network issues in addition to traditional computing and storage
issues in Cloud Computing systems, the European SAIL project\footnote{\href{http://www.sail-project.eu}{http://www.sail-project.eu}} is probably the one
which targets the biggest advances in comparison with previous works on Grid
systems. Concretely, this project investigates new network technologies in
order to provide end-users of hybrid/federated clouds with the possibility to
configure and virtually operate the network backbone that interconnects the
different sites they use\cite{sail:2012} . However, contrary to our vision, they do not
consider the UC infrastructure as a unique entity. As far as we know, the only
system that investigated whether a widely distributed infrastructure can be
operated by a single system, is the XtreemOS Project \cite{morin:2007}. Although this
project was sharing some of the goals of the LUC OS, it did not
investigate how the geographical distribution of resources can be leveraged to
tackle the current limitations of cloud computing solutions.

The novelty of the LUC OS proposal is a new way of designing systems to
operate UC resources. As previously mentioned, it can be
viewed as a distributed operating system. However, unlike existing
research on distributed operating systems that consider processes as
the basic object they manipulate, a LUC OS  will manipulate virtual
machines. Virtualization technologies abstract hardware
heterogeneity, and allow transparent deployment, preemption and
migration of VEs.
% That is why we think that leveraging virtualization can have a deep impact on the way
%distributed resources can be operated. 
By dramatically increasing the flexibility of resource management,  virtualization will
allow to leverage state-of-the-art results from other distributed
systems areas such as autonomous and P2P/Gossip-based techniques. 
While largely unexplored for building operating systems,
P2P/Gossip-based techniques have the potential to achieve the scalability required
for LUC systems.
Using all these technologies for establishing the foundation mechanisms of
massive-scale distributed operating system will be a major breakthrough from
current static, centralized or hierarchical management solutions.
Considerable research needs to be conducted to provide core operating systems services in a
fully decentralized way and without centrally maintained comprehensive knowledge of system's resources.

Finally, looking one step ahead and considering that large part of the Internet may be
seen as computing services hosted by UC platforms, the question might
be extended to : Will \discovery make possible to host/operate a large  part of
the Internet by its internal structure itself?
Similarly to the interconnection of academics and private networks and the use of the TCP/IP standard
that resulted in the Internet, the deployment and the use of the \discovery system through the
different networks might lead to a global UC platform, \textit{i.e.} \emph{the
\discovery infrastructure}: A scalable and nearly infinite set of resources
delivered by any computing facilities forming the Internet, starting from the
larger hubs operated by ISPs, government and academic institutions to any idle
resources that may be provided by end-users.
