\abstract*{
%%% RR Proposal
%To accommodate the ever-increasing demand for Utility Computing (UC)
%resources, while taking into account both energy and economical issues, the 
%current trend consists in building larger and larger data centers in a few 
%strategic locations. Although such an approach enables to cope with the actual
%demand while continuing to operate UC resources through centralized software
%system, it is far from delivering sustainable and efficient UC infrastructures.
%%
%    We claim that a disruptive change in UC infrastructures is required: UC
%resources should be managed differently, considering locality as a primary
%concern. We propose to leverage any facilities available through the Internet
%in order to deliver widely distributed UC platforms that can better match the 
%geographical dispersal of users as well as the unending demand.  Critical to
%the emergence of such locality-based UC (LUC) platforms is the availability of
%appropriate operating mechanisms. In this paper, we advocate the implementation
%of a unified system driving the use of resources at an unprecedented scale by
%turning a complex and diverse infrastructure into a collection of abstracted
%computing facilities that is both easy to operate and reliable.
%%
%    By deploying and using such a \emph{LUC Operating System} on backbones, our
%ultimate vision is to make possible to host/operate a large part of the
%Internet by its internal structure itself: A scalable and nearly infinite set
%of resources delivered by any computing facilities forming the Internet,
%starting from the larger hubs operated by ISPs, government and academic
%institutions to any idle resources that may be provided by end-users.
%%
%    Unlike previous researches on distributed operating systems, we propose to
%consider virtual machines (VMs) instead of processes as the basic element.
%System virtualization offers several capabilities that increase the flexibility
%of resources management, allowing to investigate novel decentralized schemes.
%
%% Adrien's Proposal
%
Although the concept of Micro and Nano Data Centers (DCs) has been proposed to
deliver more efficient as well as sustainable Utility Computing (UC) resources,
the questions of where deploying and how federating thousands of such
facilities are still far to be solved and  the current trend of building larger
and  larger DCs in few strategic locations still prevails.
%
In this chapter, we claim that a new generation of UC platforms can be designed
by juxtaposing the concept of micro/nano DCs with the Internet backbone:
Instead of building and deploying dedicated facilities, we propose to  extend
each network point of presence with additional servers and to operate them
through a unified system in charge of turning a widely distributed
infrastructure into a collection of abstracted computing facilities that
natively matches the geographical dispersal of users. 
%
Delivering such a system is an old objective of the distributed computing community. However, 
unlike previous researches on distributed operating systems, we propose to
consider virtual machines (VMs) instead of processes as the basic element.
System virtualization offers several capabilities that increase the flexibility
of resources management, allowing the investigation of novel autonomic and
decentralized schemes.

%When placed at the end of a chapter or contribution (as opposed to at the end of the book), the numbering of tables, figures, and equations in the appendix section continues on from that in the main text. Hence please \textit{do not} use the \verb|appendix| command when writing an appendix at the end of your chapter or contribution. If there is only one the appendix is designated ``Appendix'', or ``Appendix 1'', or ``Appendix 2'', etc. if there is more than one.
