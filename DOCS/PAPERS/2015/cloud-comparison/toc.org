*** TODO Varying group sizes
  - From Snooze (32 / 8 / 4 / 2)
  -  From DVMS (1 vs 4 vs 8)
  => Objective : show whether it is better to have an incremental
 - TODO 8 for DVMS (Jonathan) and 16 (Mario) for Snooze (just to be consistent)
  approach to build microcosm/partition or a static partitionning
  (i.e. composed of 4 nodes at the first sight)
 - What's happen when the load differs (typically if the load is
   higher we can expect more faults with small groups)
  +  65 /15 Only for Snooze with 4 LCS per GM.
   - Please see  http://onlinestatbook.com/2/calculators/normal_dist.html
- Expected conclusion: it is impossible to define the correct
  partitioning strategy since we do not know in advance the overall
  load.
** Snooze related experiments
 - Please note that most of them have been already discussed/presented
   in the 14 pages paper available on the git (14pages-vmplaces)
*** Snooze Periodic vs reactive
   - cannot be opposed to any DVMS variants
*** Assignment of LCs to GMs
- Each time a GM crashes, the way to reassign the LCs to the GMs can
  have a significant impact (if not round robin, then a GM can attract
  more and more LCs and the probability to get a crash on this
  particular GM is smaller).
 - Note that another issue might be related to the fact that there
   might be a time difference between the detection of a GM crash by
   the LCs and the GL. In such a case, the GL can reattach LCs to the
   crashed GM. However this phenomena can be limited since the LCs
   will detect that the GM is dead during the join process.
*** Variants of the join algorithms.
** TODO Number of total migration
 - Extract this information from first results (i.e. comparison of
   Centralized/DVMS/Snooze) and see whether there is matter to be
   discussed.
** Fault tolerant aspects (2nd step)
*** TODO Snooze related
- Use the particular snooze fault injector.
- Braimstorm of the first results and see what we can/have to do
  (Mario)
*** TODO DVMS related
 - Mario should send the simulator properties to Jonathan
- Jonathan, please perform similar experiments (but with the default
  fault injector).
- Adrien (fix the management of VM destruction).
- Mario/Jonathan, send any bugs related to crash to Adrien (asap).
