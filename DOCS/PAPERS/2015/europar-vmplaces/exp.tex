In this section, we, first, analyze the accuracy of \vmps by comparing
the  results of an Entropy execution through simulations and
\textit{in-vivo} experiments. This first experiment enables us to
confirm the expected behavior of \vmps Second, we present and discuss
our analysis of the three algorithms previously described.
We show that the performances of the hierarchical approach could
reached the distributed ones through minor changes.
