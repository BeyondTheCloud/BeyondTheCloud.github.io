\section{Simgrid, a Generic Toolkit To Build Simulators}
\label{sec:sg}


% Developed for more than a decade,
% and used in a large number of studies described in mor than
% 100~publications,
\sg is a toolkit for the simulation of potentially complex algorithms
executed on large-scale distributed
systems~\cite{casanova:hal-01017319}.
%
To perform simulations, users develop a \emph{program}, and define a
\emph{platform} and a \emph{deployment} files. The \emph{program}
typically leverages \sg's MSG API that allows end users to create
and execute \sg abstractions such as processes, tasks, VMs and network
communications. The \emph{platform} file provides the physical
description of all resources that are the object of the simulation.
% composing the environment and on which aforementioned computations
% and network interactions will be performed in the \sg world.  (host,
% CPU capacity, network topology and link capacities, etc.)
The \emph{deployment} file is used to launch the different \sg
processes of the program on the simulated nodes.
% (at least the mapping between one process and one host is mandatory
% to start the simulation)
Finally, the simulation is orchestrated by the \sg engine that
internally relies on a constraint solver to assign the CPU/network
resources during the entire
simulation.% (for a complete overview see ~\cite{casanova:hal-01017319}).


We chose to base \vmps on \sg
since (i) the latter's relevance in terms of performance and validity
has already been demonstrated~\cite{simgridpub} and (ii) because it
has been recently extended to integrate VM abstractions and a live
migration model \cite{Hirofuchi:2013:ALM:2568486.2568524}. In addition
to enabling researchers to control VMs in the same manner as in the
real world (\eg create/destroy VMs; start/shutdown, suspend/resume and
migrate them),
the live migration model provided by \sg  is the only one that successfully determines
correctly the time and the resulting network traffic of a migration by taking into
account the competition arising in the presence of resource sharing
and the memory refreshing rate.

% as the resulting network traffic.
These two capabilities were
mandatory to build \vmps.%our VM placement simulator toolkit.
