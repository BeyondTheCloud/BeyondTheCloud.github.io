% Most current infrastructures for cloud computing leverage static and
% greedy policies for the placement of virtual machines. Such policies
% impede the optimal allocation of resources and the satisfaction of
% operational guarantees like service-level agreements. In recent years,
% more dynamic and often more efficient policies based, \eg on
% consolidation and load balancing techniques, have been developed. Due
% to the underlying complexity of cloud infrastructures, these policies
% are evaluated either using limited scale testbeds/\emph{in-vivo}
% experiments or ad-hoc simulator techniques. These validation
% methodologies are unsatisfactory for two important reasons: they (i)
% do not model precisely enough real production platforms (size,
% workload representativeness, failure, etc.) and (ii) do not enable the
% fair comparison of different approaches.

% In this article, we propose \vmps, a dedicated simulation framework to
% perform in-depth investigations of VM placement algorithms and compare
% them in a fair way. Built on top of the \sg simulation platform, our
% framework provides programming support to easy the implementation of
% placement algorithms and runtime support dedicated to load injection
% and execution trace analysis. \vmps supports a large set of parameters
% enabling researchers to design simulations representative of
% real-world scenarios. We also report on a validation of our framework
% by evaluating three classes of placement algorithms: centralized,
% hierarchical and fully-distributed ones. We show that \vmps enables
% researchers (i) to study and compare such strategies, (ii) to detect
% possible limitations at large scale and (iii) easily investigate
%different design choices.

%Due to the underlying complexity of cloud infrastructures,
Advanced Virtual Machines placement policies are evaluated either
using limited scale \emph{in-vivo} experiments or ad hoc simulator
techniques. These validation methodologies are unsatisfactory. First
they do not model precisely enough real production platforms (size,
workload representativeness, etc.). Second, they do not enable the
fair comparison of different approaches. 

To resolve these issues, we propose \vmps, a dedicated simulation
framework to perform in-depth investigations and fair comparisons of
VM placement algorithms. Built on top of \sg,
%simulation toolkit,
our framework provides programming support to ease the implementation
of placement algorithms and runtime support dedicated to load
injection and execution trace analysis.  It supports a large set of
parameters enabling researchers to design simulations representative
of a large space of real-world scenarios.
%The accuracy of \vmps has been validated by comparing simulated and
%in-vivo execution on top of Grid'5000.
We also report on a comparison using \vmps of three classes of
placement algorithms: centralized, hierarchical and fully-distributed
ones.
